# flat_chess
We got really into queen's gambit and therefore chess. I made a six player chess board of our flat with some slightly altered rules.
To see the full rules please check the Rules.txt file. 
You can create you're own rules to the game. 

Current Bugs:
  Knight's can still jump over walls
  Game has crashed when over 50 moves were made
